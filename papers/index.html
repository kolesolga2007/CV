Machine translation is one of the most widely used natural language processing applications to facilitate communication between people in different languages. Current machine translation methods are based on deep neural networks and complex natural language models. To train these methods, it is necessary to have at the disposal of developers a large dataset containing pairs of parallel sentences: in each pair there is a sentence in the source language and its equivalent in the target language. This dataset has to include hundreds of thousands or millions of parallel sentences. For languages with low digital resources, it is very difficult and sometimes impossible to collect parallel texts of sufficient size to train deep neural networks. This project is dedicated to the development of new methods, neural network architectures, and other language models that achieve good quality translation for languages with low digital resources.</span></p><p><strong>2022<br></strong><strong>Computational analysis of semantic similarity in collocations and free word combinations</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to classify texts, analyze topics, detect sentiments in opinions of users of various websites and social networks, semantic similarity analysis of words is needed. Words of a natural language occur in two types of combinations: fixed combinations or collocations and free combinations. Depending on these types of combinations, word meaning can vary, so its semantic similarity can also vary. In the present project, we study the semantic similarity of words used in the two types of combinations mentioned above, we investigate mathematical definition of semantic similarity and its measurement methods. We consider different semantic similarity measures; each measure depends on the objective of a specific computational text processing task. Also, implementation details, style, syntactic and pragmatic features of texts impose their own restrictions on how semantic similarity between words is to be evaluated. This project considers different techniques of measuring semantic similarity between words and their combinations, also between sentences, analyzing their advantages and limitations. We develop computer programs to evaluate semantic similarity using existing English and Spanish textual corpora.</span></p><p><strong>2021<br></strong><strong>Computational Text Processing for Information Extraction and Personality Analysis</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most information is found on the web in the form of texts in natural language. Written or spoken texts are the main means of communication between people to provide information. However, texts are generated not only to inform other people or institutions, a text can also serve as evidence of personality, transmitting the mood of its author, her emotions, exposing implicitly different personal traits such as sex, age, social status, education, place of origin, occupation, and preferences of the author. The task of extracting information and analyzing personality through texts is very important but also complex. Information included in texts is not structured, i.e., it is necessary to automatically detect which part of the text speaks of entity, for example, an object, person, location, institution, and which part of the text reflects relationships between entities. This means it is necessary to develop methods for detecting and extracting entities and relationships between entities in order to generate a structured information base. In such a base, information will be categorized and labeled for its later use in making decisions. In addition, it is important to validate the authenticity of the information by automatically analyzing the personality through texts and comparing the results of the analysis with the data provided by this person. It could be validated whether, e.g., the age, sex, or education of the person indicated in her Curriculum Vitae or her account on social networks correspond or not to those detected from the texts of messages or essays written by this person. Today, more activities are carried out in the virtual environment, therefore, it becomes increasingly important to check authenticity of information and communication. This project contributes to a solution of this challenge.</span></p><p><strong>2020<br></strong><strong>Development of Methods Based on Machine Learning and Neural Networks for Spanish Text Classification</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The classification of texts is one of the fundamental objectives in the automatic natural language processing. The rapid development of information technologies has generated the phenomenon of accumulation of massive amounts of data (big data) whose larger part is texts in different human (natural) languages, but their manual classification is no longer possible. So it is very important to develop automatic classification algorithms that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">consist in mapping a text to one or several classes defined above. Frequently the classes are topics: business, science, health, sports, among others. However, any concept of interest can be defined as a category: emotions, genders, author's name, age, gender, etc. There are several methods of classification, but they still suffer from several problems not adequately solved: the problem of overfitting training data, the slow execution over large amounts of texts, scalability, that is, the ability of a classification algorithm to work if applied to different types of texts, for example, to texts of different themes, in another language, to another taxonomy of classes or to texts of another size (to short texts instead of long texts). The present project will contribute to solving these challenges by developing computational classification techniques for texts in Spanish, using text normalization, the bag of words model and the vector space model, looking for the optimal values ​​of parameters and hyper-parameters that ensure high performance of the automatic classifier. In addition, neural network configurations that are going to be efficient for the classification of texts will be searched and since they require a lot of training data, a large corpus of texts will be compiled.</span></p><p><strong>2019<br></strong><strong>Semantic variation modeling in words and phrases using vector spaces and similarity measures</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This project was dedicated to solving one of the current important challenges in information technology and big data mining: the correct extraction of knowledge relevant to the user's problems and necessary for efficient decision-making in all aspects and levels of life in modern society.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the course of this project, methods, processes and techniques were developed that are capable of distinguishing and identifying with sufficiently high precision the semantics of words and phrases in the voluminous textual data accumulated on the web. These methods, processes and techniques use technologies for the treatment of semantic variation in words and phrases, vector spaces for the numerical representation of words and different measures of similarity between words and phrases.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Semantic variation is a phenomenon that is observed in Spanish and also in any other language: most vocabulary words are found in texts with different meanings, that is, their semantics suffer from variation. This project has made a significant contribution to research in the area of ​​disambiguation of the meaning of words and phrases in texts.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within the framework of this project, the typical meaning of words as the prototypical representation of semantics in the minds of Spanish-speaking people and their variation in texts were investigated. In addition, new methods for calculating similarity between the varied semantics of different words and phrases were developed using the vector space model.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This project has an important social impact because without the intelligent and robust processing of texts accumulated on the web in the form of documents, publications on social networks and on various websites where users give their opinions on products, services and also on many topics of political, economic, social and cultural interest, these data remain unused and the important information contained in these sources cannot be used. By applying the methods developed in this project to massive textual data in order to extract relevant information, companies and institutions will be able to be adequately informed of the problems they need to solve and will be able to make decisions that will help them meet their objectives and goals in the best possible way.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project contributed to the reduction of environmental impact in the sense that the printed form of texts generated as manuals, reviews, reports and other types of documentation is avoided.</span></p><p><strong>2018<br>Text Data Mining Using Machine Learning and Deep Neural Networks</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The activities carried out during the period of this project belong to the area of ​​automatic processing of natural language texts (English, Spanish, Mandarin Chinese, etc.). Nowadays, the web has accumulated a huge amount of texts of different types—books, articles, news, messages, opinions, reviews, among others—that it is impossible to manually review in order to extract the relevant information to solve various problems.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This project focused on problems of semantic analysis of the content of textual data by mining some aspects of semantics: the detection of semantic classes of phrases, the identification of reliable and false information in user profiles, the estimation of the probability of sexual harassment in messages on social networks and the determination of the metonymic meaning of words that characterizes the use of these words in rhyming figures. To solve the mentioned problems, several models, techniques and algorithms of natural language processing were implemented and adapted and new solution methods were also proposed and developed. The detection of semantic classes of verb-noun phrases was performed by combining deep neural networks and deep learning, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">which is a new method in this natural language task. The semantic classes were defined by lexical functions that were detected in news texts with a higher precision than in the state of the art.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The identification of reliable and false information in user profiles was performed for the particular case of Facebook. Machine learning methods were designed to calculate the confidence value from relative and weighted word frequencies. The confidence value measures the correspondence between the use of words and such aspects as the age and gender of the user, additionally taking into account the number of his or her friends and the number of days in which the user did not make any posts.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The estimation of sexual harassment in messages on social networks involved the calculation of similarity between words used in messages and typical words for sexual harassment, also adding information about feelings and message polarity.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The determination of metonymic meaning was performed by developing a new associative approach to analyze expressions of said rhetorical figure. Using associative information, conceptual distances between words in a sentence, and supervised machine learning, a decision tree was trained whose accuracy outperformed the state-of-the-art results on this task.</span></p><p><strong>2017<br>Comparative analysis and recognition of phonetic, syntactic, combinatorial and semantic patterns in oral and written texts </strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This project was dedicated to the comparative analysis and automatic recognition of patterns that are located at the four different levels of natural language phenomena: at the phonetic, syntactic, combinatorial and semantic levels.</span></p><ul><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the phonetic (phonic, phonological) level, the sound material that the language uses to construct communicative units is studied. In this project, the basic phonetic patterns of pronunciation errors in the English language by learners whose native language is Mexican Spanish were determined and analyzed. This work was carried out in cooperation with the CONACYT Thematic Network on Language Technologies. A corpus of words pronounced by native Spanish speakers and native English speakers was created and annotated in order to compare the pronunciation patterns.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the syntactic level, the functions of words or combinations of words in sentences are analyzed. Combinations of words can have different structures depending on the meaning they are intended to communicate. In this project, syntactic patterns defined by the concept of lexical functions were studied. Each lexical function corresponds to a certain syntactic pattern. Methods for automatic recognition of these patterns were developed.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the combinatorial level, word compatibility patterns are observed and analyzed. It was found that there is a class of words that freely combine with broad semantic categories of other words that express basic communicative concepts at a high level of generalization and abstraction (for example, the concepts “living being”, “objects created by humans”, “natural phenomena”, etc.). Another class of words was also detected, which are combined in a restricted manner with other words that belong to smaller classes of words that represent more specific concepts (for example, “decision”, “responsibility”, “lesson”, etc.). It was found that compatibility patterns depend on the class to which the given word belongs, so the detection of both mentioned classes is important.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the semantic level, the meaning of words and phrases is analyzed. In this project, the fundamental semantic patterns found in verb-noun phrases were identified and recognized, where the noun has the syntactic function of the direct object of the verb. These semantic patterns are the third element of the concept of lexical functions, the first element is the syntactic aspect, the second element is the combinatorial aspect. For example, the lexical function called “Oper1” has the semantic pattern “The agent performs the action represented by the noun”, the lexical function called “CausFunc1” represents the semantic pattern “A participant in the situation causes the agent to perform the action”. Methods for detecting semantic patterns defined by lexical functions were developed.</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned above, in this project, automatic methods for the analysis and detection of various patterns were developed. The error patterns found and defined are an important contribution to the different areas of science and education. Phonetic error patterns can be used in teaching English pronunciation and correcting and decreasing the accent in the speech of Mexican students using intelligent tutoring computer systems. The patterns found at the syntactic, combinatorial and semantic levels contribute to the process of automatic understanding of the Spanish language and the generation of texts in this language by computer. The analysis of verb-noun phrases was carried out and patterns of regular and recurrent word use were found that allow the correct recognition of the meaning of words, phrases, sentences and texts and also the appropriate selection of words in various contexts in text generation systems and the writing of texts in various domains and styles.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The research work carried out in this project is very important in innovative technologies applied in areas of communication and production. In fact, in all areas of community life a lot of data is being generated, the size of which no longer allows manual processing. This is the problem of big data. Therefore, robust and effective methods are needed for the extraction of information and knowledge from big data. The results of this project are a response to the problem of analysis and recognition of fundamental patterns in big data, the application of which will allow the identification of the units of information necessary for decision making in many aspects of society's life.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The work done within the macro of this project is a contribution to solving the pattern recognition task.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p><p><strong>2016<br></strong><strong>Methods of computational analysis of written and spoken texts for recognition of semantic relations and evaluation of expression skills </strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this project, methods of computational analysis of written and spoken texts were developed and implemented for the identification of semantic relationships between words and phrases as well as for the assessment of expression skills and the coherence of argumentation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Algorithms for semantic analysis of words and phrases in texts were created for the detection of semantic features and relationships between lexical combinations. The calculation of similarity values ​​between words and phrases was also performed. In addition, a computational support tool was developed for the assessment of written expression and argumentation skills.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The implementation of this project is very important in the technologies implemented in communication and other areas of production and science, because today we are faced with the challenge of large data accumulated on the Internet. Therefore, there is a need to process these data automatically, in order to extract the necessary information in an appropriate way for its subsequent use in making relevant and effective decisions.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This project contributed to the resolution of the issue of automated semantic analysis of large data in the form of natural language texts. The project focused specifically on computational analysis of word constructions with the aim of extracting their features and using them as traits in the vector space model that is widely used in various types of natural language processing applications. The applications considered in this project were the application of meaning detection using lexical functions, the application for identifying synonymous and anaphora relations, the applications for the detection and attribution of authorship of texts in social networks.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, the methods of analysis of various semantic relations were developed: the association relation between words in free expressions and multi-word expressions, the synonymous relation between words, the anaphoric relation between nouns and pronouns in texts. In addition, the similarity relations between various types of phrases and texts were analyzed with the aim of author detection.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the feature extraction in the project, existing lexical resources were used and new resources were also created for authorship attribution and detection of errors in English pronunciation. The project included the design of several computational methods, including methods for identifying semantic classes of generalized meaning such as ‘do’, ‘have’, ‘perform’, ‘begin’, ‘continue’, ‘end’ in sentences, as well as methods for determining the cohesion of words in sentences.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For spoken texts, the project included the development of techniques for studying the similarity between the pronunciation of English words by Mexican students and the pronunciation of the same words by native English speakers in order to identify and correct pronunciation errors and improve the quality of the development of speaking skills.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results of the research within the framework of this project were published in two international conferences, in international (two articles in JCR journals) and national journals, a book was also published by the national publishing house (Mexican Society of Artificial Intelligence) and a paper was presented at the research seminar at the Escuela Superior de Cómputo. In order to keep abreast of the latest research results on automatic processing of natural language texts, two research events were attended thanks to the resources allocated to this project.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A final project was carried out, which was dedicated to the development of a website for the Higher School of Computing, and a master's thesis on the topic of automatic processing of natural language texts was carried out at the Computing Research Center.</span></p><p><strong>2015<br></strong><strong>Semantic analysis of collocations using lexical functions for its application in computational processing of texts in natural language</strong></p><p data-start="130" data-end="457">In this project, a semantic analysis of Spanish verb-noun collocations was carried out using <em data-start="223" data-end="242">lexical functions</em>, a linguistic concept developed within the theoretical framework of the Meaning–Text Theory. Lexical functions represent basic generalized meanings such as "do," "cause," "begin," "continue," "end," among others.</p><p data-start="459" data-end="902">Collocations, on the other hand, are word combinations like <em data-start="519" data-end="535">dar una vuelta</em> ("take a walk") or <em data-start="555" data-end="575">tomar una decisión</em> ("make a decision"). The automatic analysis of collocations cannot be performed simply by concatenating the meanings of the two constituent words. For example, the semantics of <em data-start="753" data-end="769">dar una vuelta</em> is not the meaning of <em data-start="792" data-end="797">dar</em> (“to give”) combined with <em data-start="824" data-end="832">vuelta</em> (“turn”); that is, <em data-start="852" data-end="868">dar una vuelta</em> does not mean “to give a turn.”</p><p data-start="904" data-end="1352">Collocations pose a challenge in many natural language processing tasks, including machine translation, information retrieval, and computer-assisted language learning. In this project, supervised machine learning methods were used to detect lexical functions as semantic classes of collocations. The extent and precision with which word senses and hypernymy relations from the Spanish WordNet ontology distinguish lexical functions were analyzed.</p><p data-start="1354" data-end="1666">A new measure of collocation cohesion was also proposed and evaluated across various semantic classes of collocations. In addition, other natural language processing methods were developed: for detecting relationships between concepts in the Wikipedia graph and for a novel semantic similarity measure for texts.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p><p> </p></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p class="footer-text">All rights reserved © 2025</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://kolesolga2007.github.io/CV/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://kolesolga2007.github.io/CV/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
